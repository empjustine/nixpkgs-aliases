error: Package ‘nodejs-16.20.2’ in /nix/store/3s69yxbbl116zwga3i6cy7prplywq0bn-source/pkgs/development/web/nodejs/v16.nix:16 is marked as insecure, refusing to evaluate.


       Known issues:
        - This NodeJS release has reached its end of life. See https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/.

       You can install it anyway by allowing this package, using the
       following methods:

       a) To temporarily allow all insecure packages, you can use an environment
          variable for a single invocation of the nix tools:

            $ export NIXPKGS_ALLOW_INSECURE=1

        Note: For `nix shell`, `nix build`, `nix develop` or any other Nix 2.4+
        (Flake) command, `--impure` must be passed in order to read this
        environment variable.

       b) for `nixos-rebuild` you can add ‘nodejs-16.20.2’ to
          `nixpkgs.config.permittedInsecurePackages` in the configuration.nix,
          like so:

            {
              nixpkgs.config.permittedInsecurePackages = [
                "nodejs-16.20.2"
              ];
            }

       c) For `nix-env`, `nix-build`, `nix-shell` or any other Nix command you can add
          ‘nodejs-16.20.2’ to `permittedInsecurePackages` in
          ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix, like so:

            {
              permittedInsecurePackages = [
                "nodejs-16.20.2"
              ];
            }
