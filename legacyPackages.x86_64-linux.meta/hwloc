It also\ngathers various attributes such as cache and memory\ninformation.  It primarily aims at helping high-performance\ncomputing applications with gathering information about the\nhardware so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently.\n\nhwloc may display the topology in multiple convenient\nformats.  It also offers a powerful programming interface to\ngather information about the hardware, bind processes, and much\nmore.\n","maintainers":[{"email":"fpletz@fnordicwalking.de","github":"fpletz","githubId":114159,"keys":[{"fingerprint":"8A39 615D CE78 AF08 2E23  F303 846F DED7 7926 17B4"}],"name":"Franz Pletz"},{"email":"markus.kowalewski@gmail.com","github":"markuskowa","githubId":26470037,"name":"Markus Kowalewski"}],"name":"hwloc-2.9.3","outputsToInstall":["out","man"],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd13","x86_64-freebsd13","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode","x86_64-solaris","javascript-ghcjs","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","loongarch64-linux","m68k-linux","microblaze-linux","microblazeel-linux","mipsel-linux","mips64el-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","mmix-mmixware","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","aarch64_be-none","aarch64-none","arm-none","armv6l-none","avr-none","i686-none","microblaze-none","microblazeel-none","msp430-none","or1k-none","m68k-none","powerpc-none","powerpcle-none","riscv32-none","riscv64-none","rx-none","s390-none","s390x-none","vc4-none","x86_64-none","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-windows","i686-windows"],"position":"/nix/store/3s69yxbbl116zwga3i6cy7prplywq0bn-source/pkgs/development/libraries/hwloc/default.nix:55","unfree":false,"unsupported":false}
