It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms\nare largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly\nand open curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to\nforce a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn't compromise, allowing letters to\nbe settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural\nreading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.\n\nThis is the Roboto Slab family, which can be used alongside the normal\nRoboto family and the Roboto Condensed family.\n","maintainers":[{"email":"malaquias@gmail.com","github":"romildo","githubId":1217934,"name":"Jos√© Romildo Malaquias"}],"name":"roboto-slab-2.000","outputsToInstall":["out"],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd13","x86_64-freebsd13","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode","x86_64-solaris","javascript-ghcjs","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","loongarch64-linux","m68k-linux","microblaze-linux","microblazeel-linux","mipsel-linux","mips64el-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","mmix-mmixware","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","aarch64_be-none","aarch64-none","arm-none","armv6l-none","avr-none","i686-none","microblaze-none","microblazeel-none","msp430-none","or1k-none","m68k-none","powerpc-none","powerpcle-none","riscv32-none","riscv64-none","rx-none","s390-none","s390x-none","vc4-none","x86_64-none","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-windows","i686-windows"],"position":"/nix/store/3s69yxbbl116zwga3i6cy7prplywq0bn-source/pkgs/data/fonts/roboto-slab/default.nix:25","unfree":false,"unsupported":false}
