Its main application is chop-backup, an\n        encrypted backup program that supports data integrity checks,\n        versioning at little cost, distribution among several sites,\n        selective sharing of stored data, adaptive compression, and more.\n        The library itself, which chop-backup builds upon, implements\n        storage techniques such as content-based addressing, content hash\n        keys, Merkle trees, similarity detection, and lossless compression.\n        It makes it easy to combine them in different ways.  The\n        ‘chop-archiver’ and ‘chop-block-server’ tools, illustrated in the\n        manual, provide direct access to these facilities from the command\n        line.  It is written in C and has Guile (Scheme) bindings.\n","maintainers":[],"name":"libchop-0.5.2","outputsToInstall":["out"],"platforms":["aarch64-linux","i686-linux","loongarch64-linux","m68k-linux","microblaze-linux","microblazeel-linux","mipsel-linux","mips64el-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","powerpc64-linux","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","loongarch64-linux","m68k-linux","microblaze-linux","microblazeel-linux","mipsel-linux","mips64el-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux"],"position":"/nix/store/3s69yxbbl116zwga3i6cy7prplywq0bn-source/pkgs/development/libraries/libchop/default.nix:37","unfree":false,"unsupported":false}
