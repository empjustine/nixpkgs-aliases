With `nb`, you can write notes using Vim,\nEmacs, VS Code, Sublime Text, and any other text editor you like. `nb`\nworks in any standard Linux / Unix environment, including macOS and\nWindows via WSL. Optional dependencies can be installed to enhance\nfunctionality, but `nb` works great without them.\n\n`nb` is also a powerful text-based CLI bookmarking system. Page\ninformation is automatically downloaded, compiled, and saved into normal\nMarkdown documents made for humans, so bookmarks are easy to edit just\nlike any other note.\n\n`nb` uses Git in the background to automatically record changes and sync\nnotebooks with remote repositories. `nb` can also be configured to sync\nnotebooks using a general purpose syncing utility like Dropbox so notes\ncan be edited in other apps on any device.\n\n`nb` is designed to be portable, future-focused, and vendor independent,\nproviding a full-featured and intuitive experience within a highly\ncomposable user-centric text interface. The entire program is a single\nwell-tested shell script that can be installed, copied, or curled almost\nanywhere and just work, using progressive enhancement for various\nexperience improvements in more capable environments. `nb` works great\nwhether you have one notebook with just a few notes or dozens of\nnotebooks containing thousands of notes, bookmarks, and other items. `nb`\nmakes it easy to incorporate other tools, writing apps, and workflows.\n`nb` can be used a little, a lot, once in a while, or for just a subset\nof features. `nb` is flexible.\n","maintainers":[{"email":"nixpkgs@toonn.io","github":"toonn","githubId":1486805,"matrix":"@toonn:matrix.org","name":"Toon Nolten"}],"name":"nb-7.5.1","outputsToInstall":["out"],"platforms":["i686-cygwin","x86_64-cygwin","x86_64-darwin","i686-darwin","aarch64-darwin","armv7a-darwin","i686-freebsd13","x86_64-freebsd13","aarch64-genode","i686-genode","x86_64-genode","x86_64-solaris","javascript-ghcjs","aarch64-linux","armv5tel-linux","armv6l-linux","armv7a-linux","armv7l-linux","i686-linux","loongarch64-linux","m68k-linux","microblaze-linux","microblazeel-linux","mipsel-linux","mips64el-linux","powerpc64-linux","powerpc64le-linux","riscv32-linux","riscv64-linux","s390-linux","s390x-linux","x86_64-linux","mmix-mmixware","aarch64-netbsd","armv6l-netbsd","armv7a-netbsd","armv7l-netbsd","i686-netbsd","m68k-netbsd","mipsel-netbsd","powerpc-netbsd","riscv32-netbsd","riscv64-netbsd","x86_64-netbsd","aarch64_be-none","aarch64-none","arm-none","armv6l-none","avr-none","i686-none","microblaze-none","microblazeel-none","msp430-none","or1k-none","m68k-none","powerpc-none","powerpcle-none","riscv32-none","riscv64-none","rx-none","s390-none","s390x-none","vc4-none","x86_64-none","i686-openbsd","x86_64-openbsd","x86_64-redox","wasm64-wasi","wasm32-wasi","x86_64-windows","i686-windows"],"position":"/nix/store/3s69yxbbl116zwga3i6cy7prplywq0bn-source/pkgs/tools/misc/nb/default.nix:29","unfree":false,"unsupported":false}
